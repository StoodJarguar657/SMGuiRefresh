# SMGuiRefresh

This .dll will bind F5 to refresh the InGame GUI

## How to use

There are two methods, use a launcher such as [Carbon Launcher](https://github.com/ScrappySM/CarbonLauncher) or you can download the DLL from [releases](https://github.com/StoodJarguar657/SMGuiRefresh/releases) and inject it into the game yourself. (Wehn using a launcher, the launcher will download, inject and update the DLL for you)

## How does this work?

An explanation is in the [dllmain.cpp](SMGuiRefresh/dllmain.cpp) file.
